# Decoding-Licking-Behavior-in-Mice-from-Sparse-Neural-Population-Activity
Team Decoder, Neuromatch Academy'25
# BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION#
# Research Questions :

1. Do neurons encoding visual stimuli also encode task-relevant events?
2. Do population-level representations overlap or diverge across learning conditions and behavioral
states?
# Hypotheses :

H1 (Shared encoding): Neurons encoding visual stimuli also represent task events, indicating overlapping
sensory and behavioral codes.
H2 (Latent divergence): Population activity diverges in latent space across behavioral states, reflecting
flexible cortical reconfiguration

# Methods

Neural Data
We used spike trains recorded from cortical populations during supervised behavioral sessions in which
rats performed licking tasks. Only trials with known licking behavior labels were included for decoding.

# Models Tested
● Logistic Regression
Interpretable linear classifier serving as a baseline.
● Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Linear kernel, effective for high-dimensional sparse data.
● Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
1D feedforward convolutional architecture (CNN), designed to capture non-linear
population-level interactions.
Evaluation Criterion
● Decoding Accuracy
